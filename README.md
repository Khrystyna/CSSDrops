A place to keep sweet CSS drops - small experiments that makes me happy.

Each drop can be previewed at Dabblet:
  1. Playing with a -webkit-background-clip: text property,  inspired by Pirelli calendar 2013 (http://www.pirellical.com/2013/). Check «Enter your code» link.
     NB: Works only in Chrome(!)

  2. Will be soon...
